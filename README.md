# Experiment-for-secompax
SECOMPAX is a new bitmap coding scheme. 

SECOMPAX performs better compression ratio and fast encoding speed compared with the state-of-the-art bitmap index compression algorithm, such as WAH (Word-Aligned-Hybrid), PLWAH(Position list word aligned hybrid) and COMPAX (COMPressed Adaptive indeX).
